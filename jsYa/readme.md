## Estructuras condicionales simples

se usan cuando debemos tomar desiciones.

## Estructuras condicionales compuestas

se usan cuando tenemos dos opciones if .. else

## Estructuras condicionales anidadas

cuando dentro de una condicion hay otra condicion.

## Operardo &&
se lee como "Y", se emplea cuando una estructura condicional dispone de dos condiciones.

## Operator or ||
If condition one is true or condition 2 is true, then execute the true branch

## Switch structure
alternative to replace if structures

## While structure
This is a REPETITIVE structure which can execute one or a various instructions many times.

in this structure we have
- one or more instructions
- a test condition before each repetition

The while block repeats while condition is true

## Do while

this structure is executed at least once.
we use it if we know that the repetitive cycle is gonna be executed.
when the condition is false the structure ends.


## For structure

It's used when we KNOW how many times the instructions block is gonna be executed.

a break sentence in any part of the structure will stop it.

⬇️ three parts:
- initialization
- condition
- increment/decrement

## Functions

permits divide the program in different part helping to reduce the work.

# POO
An object is an structure that contains properties and methods. This programming paradigm is based on the concept of objects.

## Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

## Objects

An object is an instance of a class. An object has attributes and functions and methods that must done.

## polymorphism
## Hereint

To access to methods and properties we use the next syntax:
Object.property
Object.method(property)

## Methods
it's an algorithm executed responding to a message. responses to a message to satisfy requests.

# Array class
A vector is a data structure that stores a group of data.
It has a unique name and we refer to its elements by a subindex.
