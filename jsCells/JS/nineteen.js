// flat(depth) is used to flat arrays. creates a new array with all subarray elements concatenated into it recursively up to specified depth.

// flat an array means delete nested sub arrays and incorporate them into superior array.

// depth = number of flats

//We cannot use negative numbers !!!


// the last comma into the array don't affect the array in any sense.
